# Get your early adopters without writing code

In this article, we will see how you can go surprisingly far without writing any code.

Designs and mockups are marvellous tools to define your product. They serve as communication materials and shows your end goals. But that’s not the value of your product. The added value resides in what you are providing. Can you provide this value without code?

Try to put in place a system without any technologies involved. A system relies on paper. How would it work? What kind of information do you need for from users? If you are automating something, what would you do? How would your package the result of your work?

# Example

The product generates reports for real estate investors.

1. Users write down a list of criteria for properties they want to invest in
2. Go and find a list of properties matching those criteria.
3. Send them a detailed report.

A system working with paper will work with emails.

It is possible that you won’t find anyone interested in using your emails based product. Do you think it’s because it doesn’t have this shiny UI? Or could it be the product itself? At least at this stage, you didn’t spend much time or money. Only a few days to define the product and a bit of cash to buy a domain.

Now that you have users, you need to put in place systems to help you.

# Recommended books

- [The 7 Day Startup](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23290805-the-7-day-startup) by Dan Norris and Rob Walling debunks popular marketing advice like “Hack your growth” or “Optimise your funnel”. It explains how to concentrate on the business model instead.
- [The $100 Startup](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12605157-the-100-startup) by Chris Guillebeau focuses on delivering value first. I got the PETER F. DRUCKER quote from this book.
- [Will It Fly?](https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/will-it-fly) by Pat Flynn has good techniques to experiment with your product and find users.
