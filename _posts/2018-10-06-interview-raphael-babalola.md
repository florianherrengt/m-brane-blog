**Florian:** Hi Raphael. You are an entrepreneur. You’re running a company called Wanderpay.

**Raphael:** Yes.

**Florian:** Do you want to tell us more about your background, what you’ve been doing so far, where you are at the moment and what is Wanderpay?

**Raphael:** So yes, I’m an entrepreneur, CEO, co-founder of a company called Wanderpay and essentially what Wanderpay does is we make it possible for consumers to spread the cost of a travel purchase over monthly instalments. The easiest way for me to get people to understand this is you think about a long haul trip that you want to take. So let’s take Australia for example and I use Australia for a particular reason.

So you want to go to Australia. You search flights and you’re faced with average prices, which is sort of around £900 for a return ticket and that’s just you as one person. That’s a lot to be expected to pay out all at once and if we go further than that, if we now think about a family of four, your typical average family of four, we’re now talking thousands of pounds that you’re expected to pay upfront for that ticket. That can be a really sort – that can be a barrier for most people.

So the reason why it’s Australia is because that was actually a personal experience that I had. I went to Australia to visit friends, found that flights are really expensive, looks for a way to spread the cost because we can do the same with laptops, phones, furniture, etc. But didn’t find something that was readily available for flights. So having looked at this, I’ve spoken to other friends, family, etc. I found out that this is a huge gap. It was something that was a barrier for myself upon research. In fact it was a big barrier for lots of people and we started Wanderpay and simply we just give you the option to be able to that flight and pay for it 12 months after actually booking it by simply making increments of payment towards it every month.

**Florian:** OK. And you went through funding. You got some funding. You built a team. You built the product. You know, walk through the journey.

**Raphael:** So the idea stage, it was like I mentioned simply me wanting to go to Australia. I did find a way to get there but I’ve had to take the most inconvenient route possible to get there. Yes, the tickets were cheap but they were cheap for a reason.

**Florian:** Well, I think last time we talked, you said it literally saved your life.

**Raphael:** It was. Yeah, it was worth it. All of the inconvenience that came with it, sort of having to the choppy flight, the bad plane food. All of it was definitely worth it because yeah, I still say it today. I felt like that trip saved my life for multiple reasons.

But it was a trip that – and the thing was when I was going to Australia, it wasn’t that I was going to Australia with the idea of wanting to pay or go in there and then thinking I was going to come back and sort of started this business. It was just while I was out there. It was really a sort of a soul-searching sort of trip. I’ve just been made redundant from another start-up I had been working for and really had no clues to what I wanted to do next and as cliché as it sounds, I sat on a beach on Gold Coast Surfers Paradise staring into the horizon and I said, “Look, when I go home, I want to do something that I care about. I want to be able to do something that it’s going to sort of motivate me to wake up every morning.” I said, “Raph, you have no money, no savings. You have no contacts in terms of investors. But when you get home, we’re going to start a business and the business we’re going to start is – you know, it’s going to solve this very problem that you are facing when you wanted to come out to Australia in the first place.”

So from the point of having that idea to getting back, I had – what I can only say was maybe a stroke of luck in the sense that I was scrolling through Twitter and I saw a tweet that was put out by MasterCard and what they were looking for was people – you know, hackers, developers, entrepreneurs who could combine the world of payments with the world of travel.

I read that and I sort of just said, “Hmm. Yeah, this is interesting. This is literally sort of combining the two things that I’ve just been thinking about. So myself and a best friend of – I think going on 13, 14 years. We got a good stay, went along to this thing. It was a weekend long hackathon, which was held in Old Street, a place called The Trampery and we stood up in front of room packed full of people, packed full of developers, designers, other entrepreneurs. We pitched this idea. At the time, it was called something else. At the time, it was called FlyTo, just sort of fly to Australia, fly to Japan.

We pitched this idea and I kid you not, nobody took an interest. Like it was dead silent. Like it was – nobody raised their hand to say, “We want to help you build this.”

**Florian:** Avoid eye contact.

**Raphael:** Yeah, everybody is avoiding eye contact and myself and Sait, like we were just shameless. We were like, “OK, maybe people just didn’t recognise us afterwards.” So we took a piece of paper and we wrote like in really bold letters “FlyTo”. We are FlyTo. We help you pay for trips in instalments. We were walking around with like this piece of paper above our head, almost like what happens in airports when people are waiting for people. We were walking around like, “Hey, look, we’re FlyTo. Do you want to help us build this thing?” and nobody wanted to build this thing. Just nobody thought this was interesting enough.

After all of that and the teams have been set up – because what happened was you would pitch and then people would say that they want to join your team and you would have coffee in your groups and start working on it. Myself and Sait literally went back to our table on our own and we were like, “Wow. OK. What do we do now?”

I will be completely honest. At that point, a part of me was ready to go home. Not in a sense of, “Oh, like I’m defeated.” But just in the sense of oh, OK, cool. There are no developers. So I guess –

**Florian:** It wasn’t the way to go.

**Raphael:** Yeah. It was just like, “OK, cool. This wasn’t the option for us.” But Sait was like, “No. Why? Why go anywhere? This is what we’re going to do. We’re going to sit down and we’re going to map it out. We’re going to get all of our ideas on a piece of paper and if anything, at least we’re going to leave this place with a very clear idea of what we want to do and then we can take this paper somewhere else and maybe somebody else can build it for us outside of this.”

So I guess in a way, that was – Sait sort of thinking outside of the box, thinking outside of the moment. I’m so glad that he had that thought process and he encouraged us to do that because at the end of that weekend, we actually went on to win the hackathon.

**Florian:** Wow.

**Raphael:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah, crazy. We stayed there. We did sketches. We put together a business case. We’re not coders. We’re not designers. We couldn’t do any of that. But what we could do was we could put a business case together and we said we’re going to present and even if it means that we hold our pictures of just what the – at the time, it was a B2C. So even if it just means we hold up sketches of what it’s going to look like, we said, “Look, we’re going to persevere and make this happen.” Thankfully, people here in that space as well looked at us as "Hey, this guy is not going to give up”.

I think perseverance attracts favour and what I mean by that is nobody can ever knock a trial. You know, people aren’t going to look at you for trying and sort of look down on you. I think there’s something in everyone where they see somebody that’s trying and even if you can’t directly help yourself, you think to yourself, “How can I maybe get somebody else involved that can help this person?”

That’s exactly what happened to us. We had people within that room who sort of saw what we were doing and they were like – and people making phone calls on our behalf, people who weren’t in the place at all. We had one guy, a guy called Will Mersa [0:08:52][phonetic], absolute legend. He made a phone call to a friend of his. He was an Android developer and he was like, “Hey, look mate. You need to come down. There are these two guys Raphael and Sait are working on this really good idea. I think they’ve got something,” and the guy’s name was Dom. Dom was like, “Cool. I will come down. I will see what this is about.”

He came down. We had a conversation and said, “This is what we’re trying to build,” and he was just like, “Yeah, I get it. Let’s make it happen.” So it was myself, Sait, Dom. So now we’re a team. We’ve got someone who’s building like a very, very basic version of what like an Android app would look like. Myself and Sait are working on a business case doing research and how many people would use this, etc, and then we had one other guy.

So I was part of a group called YBTL. It’s a Slack group. So it’s called Young Black Tech London.

**Florian:** Young Black Tech London.

**Raphael:** Yeah. So it’s essentially a community of – I think we’re talking thousands of young black innovators, investors, entrepreneurs, coders, designers, etc. So I put out a quick message in there and I said, “Hey, look. I’m at this thing. I don’t know if anybody can help. But I’m just going to try my luck and see if anybody is interested in coming down to help out.”

We had one guy, a guy called Tyro [0:10:21][phonetic]. He was like, “Yeah, I’m a designer. I’m happy to come down. I’ve got my experience. I think this will be cool,” and yeah, so now I have a designer, a developer, myself, Sait and it was – it went on from Friday to Sunday. So Sunday was the final and that’s when you present to the execs from British Airways, MasterCard, Sabre, really, really big players in the world of travel and payments and we put this presentation across and I think there’s even a video on the internet. I think it’s on YouTube. In fact it is on YouTube. I will send you the link for it.

I just remember sort of we’ve done our pitch and I was so nervous. But for some reason, the whole way through, Sait was like, “No, we want …” Like just this unshakeable confidence and this unshakeable belief that we’ve done enough. Like we deserve this. Like we didn’t go home when everything was telling us to go home. Like we deserve to have some sort of respite for that. We deserve something back for that.

I remember the moment exactly when the presenter said, “The judges thought that this was something that was not only beneficial to consumers but also businesses. They like how easy the product is to understand the winner is …” and they announced the team name. At the time, it was called FlyTo and I remember my head just dropped into my hands because I was just overcome with emotion and just this feeling of we literally – I don’t know if it sounds dramatic but it felt like justice. It felt like in a way, nobody wanted to be a part of this. We stuck it out. All of the odds were against us. But we came out on top and I remember sort of being interviewed afterwards and describing it in a way of like it – it felt like a Slumdog Millionaire type, movie type of situation. But yeah, like that was the first injection of any capital and I guess confidence. We received a nice cash injection from MasterCard and that’s where the journey started.

We were able to use that to get some designs put together – start the process of what the product would look like. With that, we were fortunate enough to then go from winning the hackathon to a few months later being accepted into a start-up acceleration program which was called Wyara which is partly funded by Telefonica over in Piccadilly Circus and yeah, again we received some funding from that, significantly more than what we had received from MasterCard.

So now we were really able to put some work into this. They put us in a nice office in Soho and now we could sort of really sort of put in developers, people to really build this out and make something of it. From there, we were put in a position where we had enough for us to be able to go out and start speaking to customers, start engaging banks, to be a part of what we were doing and to sort of give context.

So the way Wanderpay works is – so we integrate our software into the travel brand’s existing website. So when a consumer gets to the point of payment, we say, “Hey, we can use Wanderpay to pay this off.” What happens when a consumer does that is we actually offer essentially a loan on the customer’s behalf. So we partner with banks and we approach these banks all in real time with the details of that customer and we’re essentially asking the banks, “Hey, who wants to pay for this flight, pay for this holiday on this customer’s behalf?” with the promise of them repaying you back in 12 months.

We had a product. We could take to two banks in London who both agreed to be our first financial partners in what we’re taking to market and then with that, subsequently after that, we went for the process of becoming FCA approved because we were essentially a credit broker. Then we just started having conversations with really reputable, respected travel brands. You know, we’re talking airlines like KLM, some of the biggest travel brands in the UK like Tumi and it was just from what was a really messy sort of turnout from me sort of being made redundant at the start-up I was working with, going out to Australia, coming back with this wacky idea and again to reiterate, I had no money, no savings, no contact with investors or anything like that. Just the shared decision of, “Hey, I’m going to go home and start a business,” and for it to come to fruition and for us to be at this stage that we’re at now.

To this day, it’s still a crazy chain of events, especially how there’s so much serendipity and I guess creating our own luck involved in it as well. But yeah, that’s like the genesis of Wanderpay, what was previously FlyTo to where we’re at now where we’ve gone on to receive further investment from venture capitalists and angel investors. We’ve been able to get agreements with other customers. We’ve partnered with banks. We’re got products that we’re taking to market and we’ve built a team of people who believe in what we’re doing and want to see people have access to travel and that’s sort of what we’re currently at.

**Florian:** So it’s a very inspiring story there. Also I think what you really demonstrated is that you – you kept trying, trying and trying. At that point, that’s actually what got people to want to help you. The reason why people started to help you was not because of your idea, but because of the energy and the perseverance that you just put in this project and just look at you and they’re just like, “Wow, these guys are really doing something impressive. I want to be a part of this thing.”

**Raphael:** Yeah.

**Florian:** So it wasn’t much of the idea there because at the beginning, no one was interested. And then the last thing, it’s just like at the end, you go like boom! You know what? I want. So that was quite something.

**Raphael:** Definitely.

**Florian:** Which then I guess got you even more energy to move to talking to these banks, etc.

**Raphael:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

**Florian:** So can you talk a little about joining hackathon do you think there is a – do you think someone needs to be in London to achieve a similar story?

**Raphael:** I don’t and the reason why I say that is because I feel like start-ups are popping up everywhere. It’s easy to sort of say – to look at how things are being done in the Western sort of side of the world and sort of say, “Hey, these are the places to be if you want to make it as a start-up or a tech founder,” whatever it may be. But I think you really don’t have to look too far to see that start-ups are popping up everywhere and great founders, great businesses are thriving in different places as well. You have tons of super smart, driven entrepreneurs across Africa. You have entrepreneurs in Asia. You’ve got business booming in Australia.

I think although London is an amazing place to start a business and I think that London has done an amazing job to sort of make it easier for people to start a business, I don’t think that you necessarily have to be in London to start a business. What makes up an entrepreneur is – a way is you’re going to find a way. So it doesn’t matter if you’re in London. It doesn’t matter if you’re in Moscow or Lacoste or Mumbai. You could be anywhere.

The fact is as an entrepreneur, your job is to look around yourself and find the resources to make it happen and yeah, in short, no. I don’t think it’s limited to London. I think you can make it happen wherever you are. You just have to sort of look hard enough.

**Florian:** I think last time we talked, you mentioned this idea about whatever happens, you will always be brainstorming, looking around you trying to find problems to solve and in a sense, this is the reason why you are an entrepreneur because you’re looking at solving problems.

So you went on building your team. You moved on, etc, and you build this product. What was the journey around like building in this team, building this product? What kind of like challenges did you face? If I’m someone who has an idea and I want to go from this amazing idea and I want to make it happen, I want to bring it into this world, what should I be careful – what should I pay attention to?

**Raphael:** So just to be 100 percent human, be 100 percent transparent. We made mistakes every single step of the way. Anywhere where you could have made a mistake, say, “I made a mistake.” Wherever it was, the things we spent money on that we didn’t need to have spent money on or hiring or just having – just being naïve. We made so many mistakes. I think that’s – I think what you need to do is as you’re going through this process and you’re making mistakes, don’t look at mistakes in a way like – like it’s all bad because it is a – because essentially what it’s doing is you’re sort of shedding – you come in as a first-time founder with – surrounded with all of this optimism and fearlessness and just thinking that everything is going to be perfect and you make mistakes and then you realise, “Oh, OK, cool. So that’s how it’s meant to work.”

Then you go a step further and you make another mistake and you go a step further, you make another mistake. You’re shedding away all of these outer shells and outer layers and eventually you will get to the point of the core and the core is where you have – it’s where you’re just – Sait has this thing of saying you’re in the pocket, yeah.

**Florian:** OK.

**Raphael:** And in the pocket is like saying you’re just – you’re in your flow and the only way you get there is by making mistakes. You have to make those mistakes to get there because you make the mistake. If you’re paying close enough attention, you should never make that mistake.

**Florian:** You learn.

**Raphael:** Yeah, you learn from it, exactly. You learn from that mistake. So as you go on – and sometimes, it’s not even within the same start-up. It could be your first start-up failed, second start-up failed, third, fourth, fifth all failed. You get to the sixth and then it hits because you’ve just picked up so many lessons from all of those mistakes, that you’re just – you’re constantly refining yourself to the point where you now – you become super-efficient and you know what you’re supposed to be doing, when you do it, how you do it. So you just get so much of that.

So in our case, when did we make mistakes? So the first mistake was – I remember when we were speaking to investors like super early on and they were super excited about the project and we didn’t actually make the mistake but we nearly make this mistake. So I had a conversation with these guys and they were like, “Oh, we love the idea. We love what you’re doing. We think this is going to be huge. We would like to make an investment. So we’re prepared to invest 10,000 pounds,” and I was like, “Hey, that’s great.”

Bear in mind I have no money whatsoever. So £10,000 to me sounds like –

**Florian:** Exciting.

**Raphael:** Yeah, exciting. It sounds like hey, this is great. Like we’re going to do everything with this.

**Florian:** You also confirmed that someone wants to invest.

**Raphael:** Yeah, exactly.

**Raphael:** Yeah. It was huge confirmation and this was just before the MasterCard thing as well. So it was just before because it was sort of – so the date is sort of across because it was like I got back and I was having the conversation – because before I actually got back, I sent an email to every entrepreneur I meet, every entrepreneur and I said, “Hey, look. If you know any investors, just connect me with them.” Like I just want to have a conversation. But yeah, so –

**Florian:** When you say every entrepreneurs, did you do cold emails, etc?

**Raphael:** So these were all people within my network. These were all friends.

**Florian:** Friends.

**Raphael:** Yeah, these were friends or people I had just sort of met along the way, even like the friend of a friend or met them at an event. I just sent an email to everybody and the email was really simple. It was just like, hey look, I lost my job. I’m currently in Australia. I’m coming back to London. I have no idea what it is I want to do with my life. But can I spend the next six months sort of interning with you?

What’s funny is I came home and a friend of mine, a guy called James, he runs an amazing company called Bitstocks. He said, “Raph, come and meet me. Let’s have a conversation.” What I thought was me going to intern with him was actually him introducing me to two investors. So I got there and he was like, “Hey, these are investors tell them about your idea.” So that’s how that came about.

**Florian:** Did you know it before?

**Raphael:** No, no, no. I didn’t know. I arrived and he was like, “Yeah, these are two investors.” Yeah. Two investors. Tell them your idea. So we’re having this conversation and I think – no disrespect to them and of course no disrespect to James either. But I think they probably realised that I was super eager. I needed – I wanted to get some money into the business. I was essentially willing to take whatever they were going to offer.

So they put an amount of money on the table and then they said, “Hey, but we want 25 percent of the business,” and for me, I will be completely honest as well, completely transparent here. I walked out of that meeting feeling like I had won. I walked out feeling like, “Yeah! I’m going to take the money. I’m going to start the business.” Called a few of my friends who had sort of already been around the block a bit and called Sait as well and they were like, “No. What are you doing? If you take that deal, what’s going to happen?” and sort of subsequent rounds are going to come after that.

So that was like the – one of the very first mistakes I would have made had I not had the friends to sort of go back to them and get their opinion. But then outside of that, the big mistakes for us come in the form of – we were super naïve in terms of our process around hiring. So neither myself or Sait are technical. We have a very basic understanding of how we want things to work. But at the time, anybody could have pulled the wool all over our eyes which is essentially what happened.

We worked with a developer. We told him what we want to build and they would show us something that looked like it was functional on the frontend and it looked like it was working and you could click here and do this and do that and the rest of it. We thought, “Hey, our product is being built.” But in the backend, there was actually –

**Florian:** Smoke and mirrors.

**Raphael:** Exactly that, exactly that. I guess the advice I would give to anybody who wants to build a tech product is take some time to invest in the basic knowledge you need to have, just to make sure that somebody can’t bullshit you or at least have – go to friends or a friend of a friend or relative of some sort who you can speak to when – I guess as a soundboard, as a second opinion on anything that somebody is telling you because yeah, it’s easy. It’s far too easy to be – to have the wool pulled over your eyes. That’s what happened to us and it was very costly. It cost us a lot of money. It cost us a lot of time and if we could go back – well, on the back of that, both Sait and myself were sort of taking some time to really understand. OK. What’s the process of building a product? What does it take? In terms of languages, you know –

**Florian:** Like technical knowledge.

**Raphael:** Yeah, exactly that. Sort of developing our technical knowledge not – because not just for this business and for what we’re doing here but for future businesses and especially if we want to be able to hire people and hire good people, we need to be able to understand their language. It’s all good and well when we’re hiring people for operations or sales and all of these different things. But if we really want to hire well in terms of building a tech team, there needs to be at least a basic understanding in that sense as well.

But yeah, I think that the key – our sales as well. Sales was another place where we made mistakes. That falls on my shoulders because I was essentially responsible for sales and early on I mentioned some of the really big travel funds that we were having conversations with. I think again going back to us being naïve, in – if you’re running a B2B business, which is what Wanderpay is, the sales cycles are significantly longer than what it would be had it been we built our products for consumers.

You’re building products for consumers. You’ve built it. You can put it out, decent marketing, and relatively quickly get people using the product. In our case, it was we’re building a product, we’re trying to take requirements from prospective customers and we’re trying to get our contract signed and we’re talking sales cycles of six months, maybe more. In some cases, there are people that we just been speaking to for a year.

**Florian:** Which is longer than what you’ve been running at the time.

**Raphael:** Yeah, a lot longer than what I was used to, what Sait was used to. We were just super naïve about what it is that we needed to do and I think going back in time – and that probably leads on to another thing that I think is really important. At the time, I thought like I was trying to catch the big fish immediately to further validate that this was a thing. This made sense.

Wanderpay is a business you need to pay attention to when actually what we should have done is looked for the smaller brands, niched companies who at such an early stage would actually be a partner as opposed to planning this big shout-and-dance marquee signing. What we need is people who would help us refine the product and get it even better to take it to the next level.

**Florian:** Small businesses you can talk too.

**Raphael:** Exactly that, exactly that. People that you can pick up the phone and say, “Hey look, we just made this change. How are you guys finding it?”

**Florian:** What do you think?

**Raphael:** Yeah. What do you think? OK, cool. And then we go back to the tech team with any requirements. We make the solutions. That’s a lot harder when you’re trying to do it with a big corporate company.

**Florian:** Because it takes three days to come back to you and setup an appointment…

**Raphael:** Exactly that, yeah, exactly that. In some cases, there were people we needed to speak to and they would be like, “Oh, OK, cool. Book a flight to Amsterdam.”

So yeah, whereas if we had just sort of focused on – in the really early days, just sort of the smaller brands who we could have really fast sort of small feedback loops with, then the early sort of phase of the business I expect would have sort of really kicked on a lot quicker. That’s the hope anyway.

**Florian:** And I think we talked about before as well, when you were talking about the kind of – two aspects of building this business which is one is we want to deliver this thing to people who want to travel and the other one is I want to build a successful business.

**Raphael:** Yes.

**Florian:** And how it’s hard to balance out both of those kinds of feeling that you have on building this company, but also building a successful business.

**Raphael:** So the core of starting Wanderpay was I’m super passionate about not just travel but being exposed to everything this world has to offer. I think in a world so diverse and with so many things to see, so many different foods to eat, so many smells, sounds, there’s just so much the world offers. I feel like the – one of the ways to experience this is through travel. The more you travel, the more you’re exposed to things, the more you are accepting of different people, of different cultures. You’re just an all-round – you’re just more equipped as a human if you’ve experienced different parts of the world.

That’s the core of what we wanted to be able to do with Wanderpay. Yes, the product was a financial solution which was essentially offering people instalment loans to be able to go to different places. But at the core of it, the thing that was key to us was we want people to travel more. We want people to experience more.

Somewhere along the line, it’s very easy for these things to get lost. So we had a very pure idea of what it was that we were trying to solve and when you start to sort of go down this route, it’s very easy for money to come into the frame.

**Florian:** Corrupted.

I don’t want to say corrupt but you – money is very alluring. So you throw money into anything. It’s going to get your attention. Money is like the beautiful woman in a red dress who walks into the room and everyone notices and that’s exactly what it was for us and we went from having – and we still had good intentions. We’ve always had good intentions with the business. But it went from this – you know, knowing that the key thing is wanting to help people travel to then becoming this thing of we want to build a super huge brand that’s incredibly fast-growing and this isn’t a question of good and bad or what’s good and evil. It was just – it shifts how you think about things and how you approach them moving forward.

I think that’s why I found myself doing things like going after these huge brands because in a way, I was trying to do what I felt like could help us raise the most money, what I thought like could get us towards an exit as quickly as possible, which hey, look, aren’t terrible things. Everyone is in start-ups and business for a reason.

**Florian:** Everyone needs money to run the business.

**Raphael:** Yeah.

**Florian:** You need it. There’s no –

**Raphael:** Yeah, no doubt about it. But I thought like it’s very easy to get caught up in the hype of start-ups and tech and seeing all of these crazy things on the internet and allowing that to shift how you behave on a day to day, when really what you need to do is just stay very true to what people connected with in the first place, which was us delivering this thing of hey, we want people to travel. We feel like the world should be more accessible. One of the things that we always say is we want you to see the world on your terms and that’s a very powerful statement put together because you tell someone, “Hey, you can see the world,” they instantly think of, “Oh, it’s expensive and I don’t have the time and …”

But the key thing is expense. People think about the money and that money aspect takes that notion of you seeing the world away from you. It’s on longer on your terms. It’s now on the terms of your mortgage or some other sort of thing that you need to pay off. With Wanderpay, we would say, “Hey, look, we will take care of all of that within reason.” That within reason is, “Hey, look, we can make this more attainable for you. We can make this more accessible for you.”

So we’re now putting the power in your hand and saying, “You can see the world and you can see it on your terms.”

**Florian:** You also talked a lot about this whole experience. You wanted it to be around booking a trip when you wanted to send – these are the places that we think you should be going. Here’s a card. Enjoy your trip. Like all this kind of experience to build around the actual travel. Not only the loan. It was like this whole thing you wanted to build around it.

**Raphael:** Yeah. So the finance element of this business was always the smallest part of the business for us. Yes, we are classed as a fin-tech business but myself and Sait always refer to Wanderpay as a travel tech business and the reason for that is because the focus for us is always about travel. So – and every element of travel. So we had ideas of – you know, before you actually leave for your trip, we would send you like a card, which would sort of be like, “Hey, Florian, we know that you’re going to Bali in a few weeks. We just wanted to send you this. So when you’re out there, you can write out postcards or something. You know, send us something back,” so we can then share this with the community of other people and say, “Hey, look, here’s how we helped Florian see that part of the world on his terms.”

**Florian:** It feels good.

**Raphael:** Yeah, exactly that. We wanted to really make the experience so much bigger than what it is. Traveling isn’t just you get there. We wanted it to be – we really wanted to heighten every aspect of it. That excitement you feel knowing that your trip is coming up in two weeks. We wanted to make that thought even bigger, the excitement of even when you come back and you’re looking back on memories. We had ideas on how can we make that even – you know, a much bigger thing as well.

Then how can we show you how other people within this community are also sort of experiencing all of that as well? We lost sight of that a little bit when it then became – like I said, the woman in red walks into the room and we completely lost sight of what we were focusing on in the first place. Then it became this task of chasing her around the room, trying to get her attention as opposed to just focusing on again the core of what got people excited in the first place.

**Florian:** So how do you prioritise? How do you define your priorities?

**Raphael:** So this is something where Sait is really, really good at and naturally I can be all over the place. As an “idea person,” it never switches off. It’s always happening or always having ideas and you need somebody like Sait to sort of counter that. It’s like yin and yang.

**Florian:** Oh, yeah, I need – I’m sorry. I’m interrupting you – I just remembered last time we were having food somewhere in Central London and you were like literally shooting ideas and Sait was like, “What about this and what about this? Did you think about this?” It was just like – literally like boom, boom, boom. Just like idea, comes up with the argument about – like what about this? You just like went on for like 15, 20 minutes, like non-stop and it was actually pretty sick to just – we like sat there and it was …

**Raphael:** [laughs] And I’m thinking like – so for me, I’ve come to realise how important it is to have balance and Sait is definitely the balance in that regard because left to me, we’re chasing 101 things at one time whereas …

**Florian:** … end up like a headless chicken.

**Raphael:** Definitely and I think what Sait is able to do, he’s able to take the best of ideas and even the worst of ideas and find the gold in it. I know that sounds really cliché but it’s like he’s able to strip these things down like it – he goes through this process of refining things. So it’s like if I give him – is it an ore, like a gold ore, like when it’s initially in the stone and then you – the core –

**Florian:** Yeah, the ore.

**Raphael:** Yeah. So I give him the ore and then he goes through that process of actually finding the gem or the gold within that and that’s what he does in terms of priorities as well. So typically what would happen is I would go to Sait and say, “OK, cool.” He has the research I’ve done. He has what I’ve seen from where I thought the industry is heading. He has feedback from customers, etc, and what Sait does really well is he will look at all of this and say, “OK, cool. This is where we’re at now. This is where you’re saying you want us to get to and these are all the possible routes that we can take to get there.”

So I always call Sait a sat nav because if you imagine you jump in a car, you know you’re at point A. So you’re home and you want to get to Brighton. So I simply go to Sait and say, “OK, cool. I want to get to Brighton.” Sait –

**Florian:** Make it happen.

**Raphael:** Yeah. Sait then becomes this sat nav that’s like, “OK, cool.” He goes away, thinks about, “OK, cool. This is how we get there,” and these are the things to prioritise. You want to skip past traffic or tolls or any of those things. This is the route to take to get there and that’s essentially how we go about sort of prioritising things.

Yes, I still sort of counter things and say, “Hey, but, you know, this is what I find. This is what I’ve seen.” But we just have this great process of I bring something to the table. Sait considers it, looks at what he thinks because of his own research come back and then before you know it, we have sort of like these different routes that we can take and we can say, “OK. Where are we in terms of financially can make this happen? In terms of time, can we make this happen? In terms of resources, can we make this happen?”

That’s how we decide what are the priorities. It’s all about taking all of the options and then aligning it with where are we right now? Like what is actually within our power, within our reach to make a reality? That’s the process that we take.

**Florian:** Do you think those in need – when you create this thing from the beginning, do you think you need someone who has an end vision and someone that actually is a sat nav and drives you to this place? Do you think this is essential to a team or can I be a solo founder by my own or is that just like too many skills to just master in one person?

**Raphael:** I mean I know amazing examples of solo founders who managed to make it happen on their own. But I do feel like there is something in sharing the burden and there is definitely something in bouncing off somebody who has – who has a strong way where you maybe be weak. I think that’s definitely a powerful thing.

I think that’s why even when you speak to investors, unless you are like an Avenger from Marvel or something, like they are also looking for individuals who come together and as a team, are just this formidable force who can make things happen, just complement each other in different areas.

I think for me, a part of me would always look to Sait or look to a Sait-like person for any business that I wanted to start. I think – I know where I’m strong. I know where I’m really good at and I know my weaknesses.

**Florian:** Which is as important.

**Raphael:** Yeah, which is just as important and I think what you need to be able to do is be humble enough to sort of just reach out to the people who are stronger than you in their situation and say, “Hey, look, this is where I’m at. I feel like I would be much better off if I did this with yourself. Hey look, do you want to go down this crazy journey with me?” Yeah, that’s my take on it.

**Florian:** Great. Do you want to talk about this kind of aspect of Raph the entrepreneur and Raph the black entrepreneur and this kind of – it’s a pretty hot topic at the moment, probably more than say 10 years ago. I think you were talking about the fact – like how people behave with you in different ways in the open space or this kind of a tricky situation where you end up in like, “Oh, they got some funding because they’re black,” or all this kind of like little things that stack up again and again and again. Did you want to like share your experience on this?

**Raphael:** So I think there are loads of different experience that some people have. You know, processes like funding or just being a founder in general. I feel like generally in tech, we have a diversity sort of gap and it’s not just necessarily black people in tech and start-ups, etc. It’s also women. But even if you dig deeper into the diversity gap with women, even with that, there’s an even – the rabbit hole goes even deeper.

So a lot of diversity reports, you will see a focus on women in tech, which is great, absolute – like we’re all for it. But then when you go deeper than that, there’s also – there’s a gap of black women in tech and I think that’s something that definitely needs to be looked at.

So in my experience of being a black founder being in tech and just sort of start-ups in general, there are definitely periods where you feel like you’re being involved in something because diversity is hot right now and people want to be viewed as diverse whether it’s a diverse fund or a diverse sort of initiative. You can definitely be pulled in to things that way.

In the same breath, you can also be excluded from things. You know, not necessarily in a vindictive way but just because there are biases and the biases can be as simple as you sit across the room from somebody who maybe studied at Oxford or Cambridge or whatever it may be. At that point, there’s immediately that sort of that connection. You have that connection with that person.

We both went to Oxford. We both went to Cambridge. You now have a bias and it’s not to say that a bias is negative or positive. It’s just a bias. There’s a middle ground that you’ve immediately found. But when you come into situations as a black sort of founder – and it’s not to say that black people don’t go to Cambridge or Oxford or etc or wherever it may be.”

**Florian:** I think there was a report like recently from the Financial Times that says like there’s a – no black people who joined Cambridge for like years.

**Raphael:** Wow. Yeah. I know it’s a small – in the grand scheme of things, it’s – there’s work to be done and I can’t sit here and say what the work is or how it needs to be delivered.

**Florian:** Why is it important that we actually provoke diversity more than just like wait for it to happen organically because some random dude walked in the room? Why is it important to provoke it, to talk about it?

**Raphael:** It’s important to speak about it and to sort of actively be progressive about it because again, it goes back to what I was talking about, about the need to travel. If we have different people from different backgrounds with different perspectives, who are trying to put products out there or build businesses or solve problems, we’re just going to be – to be in a much better position to actually make these things happen.

So for example, if we’re trying – so if we have problems in Africa for example – and what can I use as an example? The fact that so much of Africa is still – you know, access of bank account is just almost non-existent in some places of Africa. If we have white people trying to solve this problem, it’s very different to having people from that region trying to solve that problem because there’s a different level of context. There’s a different level of understanding. I think that’s a really extreme example because it’s so – because it’s just like super localised in that respect. But I think even in businesses that were starting today, generally like starting a business in London, we have to be able to have different people around the table who bring different perspectives, who can make us think about things that the other person wouldn’t have necessarily thought about.

So once that starts to happen, we start to build better products. We start to find better ways of doing business. We start to find better processes and consider more outcomes in how we’re doing business because if that isn’t happening, it’s going to be so easy to just completely miss out how it may affect a particular group.

If you have a room full of rich people trying to solve problems, none of the problems that are being faced by poor people are going to be solved because we’re just not in that world.

**Florian:** They’re going to be badly solved

**Raphael:** Exactly that. So we need more people from diverse backgrounds and different perspectives to be in these rooms because then we get closer to – again like I don’t want to say cliché. We get so much closer to a better world because we’re doing things that is actually in the betterment of everybody because we’re considering everybody. Then we start having businesses that are more – that show more empathy in how it’s being delivered and how people are using it.

You can build a platform that you know exactly how – whether you’re white, black, Asian, exactly how these people are going to interact with it because there has been context from different perspectives that has been put into this. I feel like I’m rambling but it’s like we just need – it’s so necessary. I can’t speak of it enough. It’s so necessary and the thing is, it’s not that we don’t have these communities. We have it. Like I mentioned earlier, we have YBTL. There’s a group called 10x10. There’s a group called YSYS. We have these groups, these clusters of amazingly talented people who are building amazing businesses and have ideas. But we need to be in these rooms and that’s only going to happen by the right conversation happening and people provoking doors to be essentially kicked down to sort of be more – what’s the word I’m looking for? Just – the words completely escape me. But we just need all of these ideas to come together because that’s when amazing things come out of there.

**Florian:** Integrated?

**Raphael:** Yeah, it’s like integrated. I can’t remember the word. But yeah, I guess integrated is like a fair word to sort of –

**Florian:** You see a lot of small groups that are getting created, Women in Tech. What was the young –?

**Raphael:** Young Black Tech London.

**Florian:** If people came up with the need of creating those groups, to be able to then integrate with the big one, what would you – how would you envision this? What would be like the end vision really if you have like a magic wand and you just go like, “Boom!” can you tell us what it would – like you walk in. WeWork– which is mostly take businesses and look around. What do you see?

**Raphael:** So I think London is great because London is just like such a metropolitan where you can meet people from every single – different parts of the world. You have loads of different languages, loads of different cultures. I think we need more of that in tech. I think one thing I always look at is I look at teams. So if I come across a business and I think, “Hey, they’ve got a really cool product,” I always go to the “about us” and look at their team.

More often than not, you will either see loads of guys or you will see predominantly loads of white guys or predominantly white team whereas that’s not really what London looks like. I think all you have to do is go somewhere relatively busy and just look around yourself and you will see people from different walks of life, different backgrounds.

**Florian:** Oh, yeah.

**Raphael:** And I think that’s where we need to get to. I feel like the way for that to happen is for – inclusive. That’s the word I was looking for.

For it to feel more inclusive because it’s not that black people don’t want to be involved in this space or black boys and black girls or just people of colour in general, they don’t want to be involved in the spaces. The fact that they don’t see enough examples of someone who looks like them, doing that very thing and that’s why this conversation is so important. That’s why we need to position people in these places to make these things happen. I don’t say it in a way like oh, people need to be in these positions for the simple fact that they’re black. No. It has to be on merit. But I think the standard is very different for different people according to where you’re from.

As a black founder, if you do something really well, it’s heightened. It’s super heightened by other black people. You can be a black guy who started a moderately successful business. But for the simple fact you’re a black guy in business that’s doing decent, it’s super – it’s like, yes, scream it from the rooftop. Somebody like us is doing it.

But on the flipside, if you do something wrong, again, it’s super heightened. Like it’s, oh, this is terrible. This is so bad.

**Florian:** We talk about this like lack of individuality in minorities when they’re seen as black – not as an entrepreneur but as a black entrepreneur.

**Raphael:** Yeah. That’s exactly what it is. It should be – it’s hard because it’s just such a complex topic but it’s so hard to not want to say we just need to be viewed as entrepreneurs. Like we just need to be viewed as people who are solving problems. But then it would take away from what I said earlier of the necessity for this conversation to happen because if – had that been the case and that’s how people are viewing it, then the exclusion wouldn’t exist in the first place.

So yeah, I definitely feel like there needs to be an element of progressively thinking about how this inclusion can happen. But at the same time, not making it feel like it’s a token stamp of approval. You know, not making it feel like, hey, you are making it into this room because you’re a black person. There just needs to be more eyes on what we’re doing. In fact that’s probably the easiest thing. Just pay more attention to what we’re doing. Pay more attention to what we’re doing and I guarantee you will find people who buy it on their own merit should be included in when these conversations are happening.

**Florian:** Great. That was really good Raph. Thank you for your time. I think we have to wrap it at some point.

**Raphael:** Cool.

**Florian:** If someone is listening to you, to us at the moment, to you and is contemplating the idea of running a business, has an amazing idea, just got back from Australia, wants to smash it, what do you want to say to this person?

**Raphael:** So first and foremost, do it. I’m not going to sort of – there’s nothing else to say other than do it and the reason why I just say do it is because – don’t sit around waiting for like some perfect opportunity to – or some perfect sign to come your way for you to be like, “Oh, yeah, I’m going to go do this thing.” Again, I started a company with no money. Like nothing in the bank account, no savings, no contacts other than people I had worked with in the past and myself, Sait and an amazing group of people, our team, managed to take a product to market and raise money and have customers and build a product.

So for me, it’s do it and what you will find is – it’s like we said earlier. If you’re trying, trying has this energy that just comes with it and it’s attractive. It attracts things towards you. But if you sit on your hands and you just wish for something, it’s not going to happen. You have to go out and do something practical about it. So for me, do it and it doesn’t have to be like this super technical thing. If it means – like find the most – like the easiest, simplest, quickest way to start doing this thing, even if it means you run your business off an Excel sheet. Do it. Just do something and let everything else figure itself out.

I didn’t come back knowing I was going to stumble into a hackthon or stumble into an accelerator. I just said, “Look, I’m going to come back and do this thing,” and things fell into place naturally. So that’s what I would say. I would just be like, look, do it. Then you obviously have the basic stuff of do your research and know the market you’re going into. Do not be afraid of competitors. If someone else is doing what you’re doing, don’t let that put you off. Understand what they’re doing. What do they do well? What don’t they do well? And stay true to – at your core, what it is you’re trying to deliver.

Trust me. It will take you a lot further than you think. If you stay true to that, then you really just have to let the universe or God or whatever it is, a higher being sort of just figure everything else out and let your stars align. But yeah, do it. Know what it is you’re trying to do. Know your space and stay true to the core of what it is you’re trying to make happen.
