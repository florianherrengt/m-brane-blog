# Introduction

You have a clear idea in your head. You have read all articles about identifying your market. You defined your mission, your purpose, and main objectives. But how do you turn this into a product? Having a great idea is important but execution makes the difference.

# Define your product from your idea

Draw your UI on paper. Yes, with a pen. I’m sure you can find one somewhere at the bottom of your drawer.

Create as many UIs as you can. You need to exhaust your options. Find all the ways to solve the problem.

Don’t put much effort into making it beautiful. We use paper because it’s easier to throw it away. When you spend time doing something, you get attached to it. You will have a small emotional attachment to a few squares scribbled on a piece of paper. But you can easily get attached to this beautiful design you spent hours on.

Keep iterating until you’re happy with what you have. Then take some pictures and create a clickable version. You can use tools like InVision but a simple PowerPoint will work.

Now, you have something to show when you talk to people about your idea. Start collecting feedbacks and improve your solution.

Once you have enough confidence, increase the quality. Repeat.

> “Nearly every man who develops an idea works it up to the point where it looks impossible, and then he gets discouraged. That’s not the place to become discouraged.” — Thomas Edison

# Get feedback from people

You don’t need expensive test environment setups to get feedback from people. Humans are highly social creatures and people love to give their opinions.

You need to find someone interested enough to tell you something meaningful. Someone who’s emotionally detached to give you an unbiased and honest point of view.

I find shopping malls and cafés to be gold mines. They always have a person bored somewhere. Go and ask them. They will be grateful you gave them something to keep their mind busy.

Because you drew on paper, it’s easy to change it on the go. Each time you hear something interesting, you can sketch it, take a picture and add it to your design.

Last time we did it, we collected more than 300 feedbacks in 2 days, quickly validating or rejecting ideas we had.

# Tips

- Don’t ask groups of friends or couples. You will disturb them. Try to find someone alone and bored.
- Make it clear you are not asking for money or any personal information.
- Dress smart casual. You don’t want people to think you’re playing around.

# Recommended books

- Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug is a must read. It’s so popular it became a standard in the industry.
- How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie is a good read if you want to improve your communication skills. The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking by the same author will help you get over your fear of talking to strangers.
- Exactly What to Say by Phil M. Jones will be useful when someone will be commenting your app.
